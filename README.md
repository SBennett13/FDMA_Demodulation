# DSPProj2
Authors: Scott Bennett, Branden Murphy, Logan Courtright

This repo holds the code for Project 2 in UMBC's CMPE 422/ENEE 610 for the Spring 2019 semester. Given a 6 channel SSB
modulated wave, we were to demodulate the .wav and concatenate the channels to reveal the embedded voice message.

Modify the 'PLOTS' vector to enable/disable plotting of the waveform.
Uncomment the 'sound' lines to hear the sounds produced by the script
